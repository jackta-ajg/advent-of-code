1) Process card games into an array of `CardGame` objects:

  {
    game: number;
    winningNumbers: number[];
    playingNumbers: number[];
    numberOfWonNumbers: number;
  }

2) Loop through card games and create a dictionary
    to hold the number of copies per each scratchcard

  {
    game: number;
    winningNumbers: number[];
    playingNumbers: number[];
    numberOfWonNumbers: number;
    numberOfScratchcard: number;
  }

3) Loop through card games and sum the `numberOfCopies`


IDEA: Add CardGame objects to an array to process and when going through that array,
      you add more CardGame objects to process if there are copies of it and remove
      it when it has been processed.
