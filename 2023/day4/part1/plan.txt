1) For every line, extract card game number (not really needed for anything),
  the winning numbers, and the playing numbers.

2) Loop through the playing numbers and if the playing number is inside
  the winning numbers, add to won numbers array. (Technically can just add to
  a `match` counter variable to denote how many winning numbers were found, but
  maybe the actual won number itself would be good to have if part 2 requires it.

3) Loop through every card game's result, and for every match, multiply an
  accumulator that starts at `1` with `2` and then add that result to a global
  sum accumulator.
